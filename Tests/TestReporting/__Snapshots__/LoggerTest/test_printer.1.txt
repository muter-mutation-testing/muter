🔎 Checking for new versions...
🎉 New version 1.0.0 available!
✂️ Copying your project to a temporary directory for testing...
✅ Finished copying your project to a temporary directory for mutation testing.
You can find your copied project here:

/path/to/destination

This directory will also serve as a backup for any XCTest logs that are generated by running your test suite.
⚙️ Running tests with coverage enabled to determine which files to mutate
+-----------------+
✅ In total, Muter discovered 3 Swift files

file0.swift
file1.swift
file2.swift
+-----------------+
✅ In total, Muter discovered 1 mutants in 1 files

path (1 mutants)
+-----------------+
📊 Determined baseline for mutation testing.
🧟 Muter is now going to apply each mutant one at a time and run your test suite for each mutant.
📃 After this step, Muter will generate a report detailing the efficacy of your test suite.
☕️ This step may take a while.
