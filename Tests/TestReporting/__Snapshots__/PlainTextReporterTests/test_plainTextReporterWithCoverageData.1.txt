Mutation Test Scores
--------------------

Muter took 00:00:00.000 to run.

These are the mutation scores for your test suite, as well as the files that had mutants introduced into them.

Mutation scores ignore build errors.

Of the 1 mutants introduced into your code, your test suite killed 0.
Mutation Score of Test Suite: 0%
Code Coverage of your project: 1%
